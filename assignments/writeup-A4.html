Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a4.task1.cpp` file and 
checking that the spline interpolation looks correct.

(##) A4T2 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a4.task2.*.cpp` files and 
checking that moving the bones works correctly and IK is functional.
I did not completely finish T2, so if that has an effect on any of the later parts,
would you be able to run my code against a completely functional A2? Thank you!

(##) A4T3 FINAL

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a4.task3.*.cpp` files and 
checking that the skeleton moves correctly when the bones are moved.

(##) A4T4 FINAL

Do you want to use the reference A3T2 solutions for this task: yes (yes/no)
Note: my triangle hit does not fully work, so in grading would you be able to run it against a 
triangle hit that does? thank you!

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a4.task4.*.cpp` files and 
checking that particle simulation behaves correctly and does not go through any surface.

(##) ANIMATED VIDEO FINAL

Your animation:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A4-writeup/reference/animation.mov" alt="Your creation">
